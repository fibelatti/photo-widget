This version brings the following updates:

* Dynamic borders that match the device's theme color (Android 12+)
* Fixed how borders are calculated, better matching what's seen in the picker
* Fixed the interval behavior after tapping to switch the photo
* Fixed "View in gallery" sometimes opening an unexpected app
* Added troubleshooting steps when there are restrictions applied to the app

Thanks for using the app!
